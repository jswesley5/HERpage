        <div class="box02"><p>H.E.R., whose real name is Gabi Wilson, grew up in the Bay during a time when the area was truly diverse, and residents were exposed to all kinds of lifestyles. She’s half Filipino, half black, and is that rare kind of mixed folk who identifies strongly with both sides, rather than choosing one over the other — or neither. Her home as a kid was distinctly Filipino, she says. You’d walk in and just know: shoes came off at the door, food was cooking on the stove and her grandparents, who lived with her at the time, were fixtures at the house.</p>
        <p> 
           <p>Music was a constant in her household as a child. Maybe that explains her prowess and natural talent when it comes to creating tracks. Songs from her combination album “Volume 1” and “Volume 2,” which was released two years ago, are still on the Billboard Top 100 list. She writes her own songs, collaborates with other musicians like Daniel Caesar frequently, and plays five instruments — the guitar being her go-to. Part of that stems from her obsession with Prince, who she says is her favorite artist, and contributed to the foundation of her musical identity, along with Lauryn Hill.</p>

        <div class="box04"><p>For the first few years after H.E.R. — an acronym for “Having Everything Revealed” — came on the music scene, media outlets obsessed over the fact that, in Sia-like fashion, she kept her identity hidden. (In person and in photographs she still keeps sunglasses on to obscure her eyes.) Why did she do that? Over and over again, she explained she wanted her music to speak for itself.</p> 
            <p>Addressing the secrecy over her identity, H.E.R. has said: "The mystery is a metaphor for who I am, or who I was at the time of creating the project [...] I feel like oftentimes we don't like to be open as people about our emotions or things that we are going through."</p>
<p>She explained further, "I am a voice for women who feel like they're alone in these situations. This project came from emotion, and that's what I want it to be about – not what I look like or who I'm with, but the raw emotion and support for women."To NPR she added, "I feel like this is the era of the anti-star. I really just wanted it to be about the music, and get away from, 'Who is she with?' and 'What is she wearing?’”
